# AnimeACS Hub Frontend (KMUTT Capstone Project Y2T2)

This is the frontend repository for the AnimeACS Hub project, a full-stack application built with ReactJS, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This repository will be merged with the backend repository https://github.com/aikidoaikido115/Capstone-final to create a complete full-stack project.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
